### syrinx.m
An ODE solver which is a mechanical model of syrinx of birds found in [Diversity within a birdsong](http://www.lsd.df.uba.ar/papers/diversity.pdf). This is the vocal box of the bird and the mechanical appartus that generates sounds with periodic airflow. 

### birdBrain.m
A central pattern generator model of the robust nucleus of the archistriatum in the bird brain that is responsible for sending commands to motor center that actuate the syrnix and control airflow through the lungs. Also from [Diversity within a birdsong](http://www.lsd.df.uba.ar/papers/diversity.pdf).

### singSyllable.m
Combines birdBrain.m and syrinx.m to create a song syllable. Generates an output from birdBrain.m by controling a single parameter for the initial condition of the model. This output is then used to drive the mechanical model in syrinx.m to create bird song syllables that can be played through the speakers. 

### RunParameterSpace.m
Runs singSyllable.m many times with different initial conditions to generate a variety of bird song syllables. These are all saved as data files. The choice of the range and the parameter tuned can be found in [Diversity within a birdsong](http://www.lsd.df.uba.ar/papers/diversity.pdf).

### PickOutSyllables.m
Goes through the output of RunParameterSpace.m and picks out all the virtual song syllables generated by brain and syrinx models. It saves these syllables as data. 

### AnalyzeSpectrogram.m
Analyzes the spectrograms of all the syllables picked out by PickOutSyllables.m and clusters syllables together using a correlational measure and heirarchical clustering. 

### CreateHMMSongModel.m 
Creates a random hidden markov model which generates bird songs by using the syllable clusters discovered in the virtually generated data. HMMs are often used to [model the sequence of syllables in bird songs](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0024516). Adds naturalistic variations in pitch of syllable voicing and also changes fundamental frequency to generate a variety of different sounding virtual bird types with specific song patterns.
